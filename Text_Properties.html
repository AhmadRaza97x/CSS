        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American
        comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics created new superhero characters.
        Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] He wanted to design a character
        who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the
        character anyway.

        Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United

        introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward
